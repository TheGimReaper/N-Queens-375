Make
./submission n {0|1|2|3}

where n is the size of the board and the second argument is the algorithm to run

0 = Brute force
1 = Backtracking
2 = Optimized backtracking
3 = Bitmask

Then the program will generate the solutions and give the number of solutions. If you want to view them, type a capital "Y". Otherwise, type "N". Then the name of the algorithm you chose, the board size n, the number of solutions, and the time it took to find the solutions will be appended to the file "output.txt"

Our project group has done this assignment completely on our own. We have not copied it, nor have we given our solution to anyone else. We understand that if we are involved in plagiarism we will have to sign an official form stating that we have cheated, and this form will be stored in our student records. We also understand that we will receive a grade of 0 for this project.
